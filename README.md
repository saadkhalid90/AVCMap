This is a simple setup of Leaflet (via Mapbox) with d3 to show dots on a map. This can serve as a base for many interesting geographically based visualizations

Nice overview of using [d3 + Leaflet](http://chriszetter.com/blog/2014/06/15/building-a-voronoi-map-with-d3-and-leaflet/). 
I found this slightly simpler to use than Mike's [classic post](http://bost.ocks.org/mike/leaflet/).
